# Classification-of-Claims-Data
Logistic Regression and XGBoost Model used to classify insurance claims data

The notebook includes the analysis of insurance claims data which is used to build machine learning models used to predict whether or not 
a client is going to claim insurance. This prediction is done based on information provided on the client, such as how many children the
client has and whether or not the client smokes.

This information can be used to predict whether pending customers are likely to claim, based on their information and how similar it is 
to the current customer information used to train the model. High risk customers, can be identified and carefully considered while low
risk customers may not need too much consideration.
